                        It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, 
                        and on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch.

                        <a href="/Character_Guide.html"><em>character-switching</em></a>. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can 
                        obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.
